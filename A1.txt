Assignment 1 - COMPX234

Objective: Design a Print queue with a buffer to solve the issue of more users printing, than there are print machines.

Functional/Non-Functional Requirements:
	- The buffer size matches the number of printers
	- A print queue should track the machines currently waiting for an available printer
	- Create a print request when a machine has something to print
	- When a printer is free, it retrieves the head of the queue, prints the required text, and removes that item from the queue
	- If the queue is already full, the machine creates a new print request, undesireably overwriting the tail of the queue, resulting in lost data
	- The machines sleep for some time, and then wake up and send a print request
	- Printers also sleep for some time. When they wake up they print the document at the head of the queue
	
	
	"Machine 21 Sent a print request
	 Machine 22 Sent a print request
	 Inserted a request in the queue from 22
	 !!!!!!Attention: Overwrite!!!!!!
	 Number of requests in the queue 5
	 Machine 11 Sent a print request
	 Inserted a request in the queue from 11
	 !!!!!!Attention: Overwrite!!!!!!"
	 
TASK 2:

 - Add synchronization solutions discussed in the lectures to resolve the problem ofoverwriting. 
 - Control the machines' access to the print queue such that no overwriting takes place, no print request should be sent if the buffer is full until a printer comes available
 - Control the machines' and printers' access to the print queue such that no two devices (machines and printers_ are accesing the queue at the same time
